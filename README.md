# AIF: Learning Computer Graphics
This repo is a cleaned up and improved version of my original one, which was linked in the Portfolio (old one has been made private).

The capabilities of this engine/library and my knoweldge of computer graphics are both the exact same, the only changes are cleanups and refactors to the code.

This whole graphics library was developed in about 2-3 days, so it's probably not that good. I haven't worked on *actually* making it a static library that I can use in game or multimedia projects, I'll get to that after all the features I want are in place, of course I will continue to develop this post-AIF with my gained knowledge.
