# AIF: Learning Computer Graphics
This repo is a cleaned up version of my original one, which was linked in the Portfolio (old one has been made private).

The capabilities of this engine/library and my knoweldge of computer graphics are both the exact same, the only changes are cleanups to the code should anyone decide to read it.
